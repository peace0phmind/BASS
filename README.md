# 🎸 BASS - Browser Agent Script System

## Overview

BASS (Browser Agent Script System) is an advanced framework for creating and orchestrating autonomous browser agents. It enables the development of sophisticated multi-agent systems capable of performing complex web-based tasks through intelligent automation. **Its core functionality is to allow LLMs to automatically analyze web page structures and generate repeatable scripts based on user instructions.**

The system starts with a small, self-bootstrapping core that first provides webpage analysis and script generation capabilities, then gradually expands to more complex multi-agent systems. The project combines a shareable script repository, leveraging community power to quickly build a large number of system automation script support.
